<h1 id="warnings">Warnings</h1>
<p><img src="Warning.jpg" alt="Butter on a cutting board"></p>
<ul>
<li>Pan-searing steaks at a higher temp can cause a lot of smoke. Open a kitchen window to avoid fire alarms going off. </li>
<li>Ensure you are using an oven safe pan. If there is none available then use a baking sheet lined with a wire rack to cook steaks. </li>
<li>Always ensure steak is at the correct temperature before enjoying. Below is a list of the desired doneness and the internal temperature for those levels.</li>
